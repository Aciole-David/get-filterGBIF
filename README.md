### motivation:
This script was kindly created to MSc Nathalia Sampaio da Silva

(LAMAT - Mirmecology Laboratory of Alto-TietÃª, University of Mogi das Cruzes),

to get data from an ant spl, but it should  work with any spl.

Just make sure to get the proper dbf

### what it does:
dbf: a large database downloaded from GBIF (e.g., all Formicidae entries)
spl: a list of species names (e.g., some ant species from a specific location)

The bash script works in 5 steps:
1 - Extract specific columns (e.g., 7 columns; gbifID, scientificName, decimalLatitude, decimalLongitude, basisOfRecord, colectionCode and catalogNumber) 

2 - Remove empty lines in column 3 and column 7

3 - Get all the lines from dbf containing the entries in spl

4 - Filters only the largest and smallest values from column 'decimalLatitude'

5 - Arrange, for each species on spl, the 7 columns for the largest decimalLatitude followed by the 7 columns for the smallet decimalLatitude.
Something like:
